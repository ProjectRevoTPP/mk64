Files requires to run n64split.

Lets keep this YAML up-to-date.

Added split.bat if that helps any new people.

Currently the yaml has named the rom file mk64.u.
feel free to request this to be changed to baserom.z64 if people like that better.
Consider that having a ton of roms named "baserom" could be confusing if rom files are ever mixed up.
